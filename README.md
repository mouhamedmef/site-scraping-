### Usage

You can use this data for analysis, visualization, or to keep track of the league's progress. The scraping script is designed to run periodically to keep the data updated.

 ### Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Important Libraries:
  - **Requests**: For making HTTP requests.
  - **BeautifulSoup4**: For parsing HTML and XML documents.
  - **lxml**: For fast parsing of XML and HTML.
  - **Workbook**: For handling spreadsheet operations.
### Clustering
The scatter plot illustrates the clustering of match scores based on home and away team results. Each point represents a match, with the x-axis depicting the home team score and the y-axis the away team score. Different colors indicate various clusters formed by the K-means algorithm, while the red "X" markers denote the centroids of these clusters. The distribution of points shows distinct groupings of scores, highlighting patterns in match outcomes. The centroids provide a visual reference for the average score in each cluster, facilitating insights into score relationships.<br>
